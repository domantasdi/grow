    <h1>Page not found</h1>
    <p>
      Looks like this page broke a habit... It's not where it's supposed to be!
      While youâ€™re here, why not take a moment to reflect? Even the best of us
      slip up now and then. Whether it's a page or a habit, sometimes things
      just go off track. The important part is getting back on course.

    <p>Remember, consistency is key. Even in browsing!</p>
