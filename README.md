# Grow

![The Grow habit tracker](/public/Grow.jpeg 'Grow')

Grow is a basic habit tracking application developed for Turing College as the first Vue3 project.

The application affords people to manage (create, edit, delete) and track different habits.

# Key takeaways

This section outlines the ups and downs I've encountered while doing this task.

- ‚¨Ü The ups:
  - I am happy how this project turned out;
  - The project has a fairly good UX and a decent UI;
  - I have fulfilled my goals set out before joining the Turing College.
- ‚¨á The downs:
  - I still find Vue confusing and it was difficult to navigate the project while trying to remember props, template slots, computed values, etc;
  - I had to follow tutorials, get help from GPT in order to proceed in some areas.

# How to setup and use the tracker

## Setting up the environment

### Install the required dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile the project

```sh
npm run build
```

```sh
npm run preview
```

## Using Grow

### Adding a new habit

You can add a new habit by navigating to the `Manage habits` section found in the navigation pane. Once you're there, enter the habit title, the trigger, and, finally, clicking the `Add` button.
In life, habits are usually triggered by something. For example, making your bed is triggered by getting out of the bed (or other triggers, in your case).

### Editing a habit

You can edit an already existing habit by clicking the `Edit` button found in the `Habit management` section. This will open a modal window, asking you to enter a new title and a new trigger. If you delete the values altogether, you will have them reminded to you in the form of a placeholder. Click `Save` when you're happy with your edits or `Cancel`, if you wish to back out.

### Deleting a habit

You can delete a habit by clicking the `Delete...` button found in the `Habit management` section. This will open a dialog, asking you to confirm the action. In addition, you are informed that this action cannot be undone.

### Deleting all habits

If there is more than one habit added to the tracker, you can also bulk delete habits by clicking the `Delete all habits...` button found below the list of habits.

### Completing a habit

Clicking `Today` in the navigation pane will automatically redirect you to the current day and display all the active habits. If you wish to complete one, click the `Complete` button on the habit. The completion will be visually denoted in two areas:

1. The habit card itself;
2. The day selector.

The day selector's style is outlined by the following conditions:

- If you complete all of the habits for the day, the selector will be üü¢ green;
- If you complete some habits, the selector will be üü° yellow;
- If you didn't mark any habits as complete, the selector will be ‚ö™Ô∏è white.

### Stopping a habit

You are free to stop a habit from tracking by clicking the `Stop...` button on the habit itself. This will open a confirmation dialog to make sure you don't stop a habit by accident. This will prevent the habit from appearing from the day forward.

# A sample array of habit objects

If you wish, feel free to use this minified `localStorage` array of objects for testing purposes:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "habit": "make my bed",
    "trigger": "get up",
    "addedOn": "2024-07-30",
    "checkedDates": {}
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "habit": "brush my teeth",
    "trigger": "make my bed",
    "addedOn": "2024-07-30",
    "checkedDates": {}
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "habit": "clean up the kitchen",
    "trigger": "have a spare moment",
    "addedOn": "2024-07-30",
    "checkedDates": {}
  }
]
```

In order to use it:

1. Create any habit;
2. Open the Developer tools of the browser you're using;
3. Open the Local storage settings;
4. Edit the value of the `habits` key and paste in the value;
5. Refresh the page.
